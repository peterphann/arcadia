# Arcadia

Bringing retro arcade games to life with computer vision.

## Inspiration
The nostalgia of retro arcade games combined with the advancements in computer vision inspired us to reimagine classic games for a new generation. We wanted to create a unique experience where players could engage with their favorite games in a completely hands-free, immersive way.

## What it does
Arcadia allows players to enjoy retro arcade games controlled entirely by body movements and gestures. Using computer vision, the platform detects and interprets specific gestures to interact with game elements, offering an innovative twist on classic gameplay.

## How we built it
We built Arcadia using Next.js for the frontend, integrating computer vision models to interpret player movements. MediaPipe was used for hand and body tracking, enabling gesture-based interactions. The architecture combines Next.js's performance with real-time processing to ensure responsive gameplay.

## Challenges we ran into
One of the biggest challenges was ensuring smooth real-time gesture detection without compromising game performance. Balancing computational load and latency for accurate movement recognition required fine-tuning the models and optimizing the rendering pipeline.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
We’re proud to have developed a unique gaming experience that blends classic arcade games with modern technology. Successfully integrating gesture-based controls that feel natural and responsive is a highlight of our project, along with creating a platform that’s accessible to a wide range of users.

## What we learned
Through Arcadia, we learned how to combine front-end technologies with machine learning models in a cohesive way. We gained insights into real-time gesture recognition, performance optimization, and the user experience aspects of designing a hands-free game interface.

## What's next for Arcadia
Next, we plan to expand Arcadia by adding more games and refining the gesture recognition algorithms for even smoother gameplay. We envision adding multiplayer modes and potentially incorporating VR support to create a fully immersive retro arcade experience.
